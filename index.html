Most canteens in schools are run under the direction of, and are accountable to, the school council. Schools may decide to provide a food service to students in several ways.</p>

        <p>The ideal time attendance solution is one that neither a manager nor an employee needs to engage—it should be autonomous, requiring input only when absolutely necessary. Unlike keycard-based clock-in systems or other manual solutions, time and attendance software requires no interaction. Enter DeskTime: the time attendance solution that tracks an employee from the moment they turn on the computer. Regardless of whether they walk away for a break, go to a meeting, or are absent altogether, you will always know their attendance status.</p>
